<br>
<h4 align="center">Our Project is performed by the utilization of ROS2 [ver:Humble Hawksbill] and Gazebo, primarily. Other than that, we have utilized OpenCV, cv_bridge, Pyzbar and RVIZ2 for our Project Work.</h4>

## Tools and Libraries
* Gazebo
  > ```sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-gazebo-ros-pkgs```
* OpenCV
  > ```sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python3-opencv```
* PyZBar
  > ```pip install pyzbar```
* cv_bridge
  > ```sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-vision-opencv```   
  >    ```sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cv-bridge```

## How to Run
* After creating the desired packages, go to the ros workspace directory.
* There, do ```colcon build``` or ```colcon build --packages-select <pkg_name>``` if you want to build a specific package instead of all the packages in the workspace.
* Now, being in the workspace directory, do ```source install/setup.bash```
* Now, in a terminal window, simply type ```ros2 launch <pkg_name> <launch_file_name>```
* * So, in our case, since we have two packages, you will have to start two terminals and initially run:   
  > ```ros2 launch warehouse_robot_spawner_pkg gazebo_world.launch.py```   
* *  After the Gazebo simulation has started successfully, we need to run:   
  > ```ros2 launch warehouse_robot_controller_pkg controller_estimator.launch.py```   
* *  Then in one more terminal window, we need to run:   
  > ```ros2 run warehouse_robot_spawner_pkg decode_qr```
